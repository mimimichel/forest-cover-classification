# forest-cover-classification
Neural network model to predict forest cover based only on topographic variables. The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. The covertypes are the following:

    Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood/Willow, Aspen, Douglas-fir, Krummholz

Independent variables were obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. Independent variables include data on wilderness areas and soil type. The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These forests have been subject to minimal human interference. Forest cover types should therefore be mainly a result of natural ecological processes.

The requirements.txt file includes all necessary packages to run the code.
